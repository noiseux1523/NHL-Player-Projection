# Regression Models for NHL Point Projection
Prediction of NHL players' points projection using historical data and machine learning regression algorithms.

## TODO
* Kedro for preprocessing
* Scraper for capfriendly
* Fast AI approach?

# HOW TO

1. Look at notebook `Pool-Dataset-Final.ipynb` and follow the instructions in the first cell.
2. Look at notebook `CapFriendly-Data.ipynb` and follow the instructions in the first cell.
3. Look at notebook `Get_Gamelogs.ipynb` and follow the instructions in the first cell.
4. Look at notebook `HMMLearn.ioynb` and follow the instructions in the first cell.
5. Go in `LSTM-Neural-Network-for-Time-Series-Prediction` and follow instructions in README.
6. Find aggregates of projections from several sources and add to `Pool-Dataset-Final.ipynb`.
7. Find aggregates of prospect evaluations and add to `Pool-Dataset-Final.ipynb`
8. Look at notebook `Player-Selection.ipynb` and follow the instructions in the first cell.
